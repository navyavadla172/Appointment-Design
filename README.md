Appointment Scheduling System
A simple Appointment Scheduling System built with Vanilla JavaScript. The app allows users to schedule, view, and delete appointments, storing the data locally using localStorage.

Features
Add Appointments: Users can enter appointment details (name, email, time, and purpose).
Display Appointments: A list of scheduled appointments is displayed with relevant details.
Delete Appointments: Users can cancel appointments, removing them from the list and localStorage.
Persistent Data: Appointments are stored in localStorage, so they persist across page reloads.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive interface that works across different devices (desktop and mobile).
Technologies Used
Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
HTML for structure
CSS for basic styling (customizable)
localStorage for persistent data storage
